### Puzzle Inputs

To conveniently fetch the puzzle inputs directly into your local setup, you can use the following utility script. Replace `2023` and `1` with the appropriate year and day's challenge you are working on. Ensure you have your session cookie in your `.zshrc` from the Advent of Code website to authenticate the request, assigned to `AOC_SESSION`.

```bash
./aoc_input.sh 2023 1
```
