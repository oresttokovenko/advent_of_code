This repository contains my code submissions for Advent of Code, showcasing my solutions to daily programming challenges throughout December ⭐️

To conveniently fetch the puzzle inputs directly into your local setup, you can use the following curl command. Replace `2023/day/1` with the appropriate year and day's challenge you are working on. Ensure you have your session cookie from the Advent of Code website to authenticate the request.

```bash
curl 'https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1/input' -H 'cookie: session=YourSessionCookieHere' \
  -H 'user-agent: YourUserAgentHere' --compressed >> input.txt
